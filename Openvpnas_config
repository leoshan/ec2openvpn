After successful installation of the OpenVPN Access Server package you will be shown the following information in your terminal:


The Access Server has been successfully installed in /usr/local/openvpn_as
Configuration log file has been written to /usr/local/openvpn_as/init.log
Please enter "passwd openvpn" to set the initial
administrative password, then login as "openvpn" to continue
configuration here: https://listeningip:943/admin
To reconfigure manually, use the /usr/local/openvpn_as/bin/ovpn-init tool.
Access Server web UIs are available here:
Admin  UI: https://listeningip:943/admin
Client UI: https://listeningip:943/

You will need to run one more command before navigating to the OpenVPN Access Server Admin UI. You will need to set a password for the openvpn admin account, to do that you can run the following command in terminal:

passwd openvpn

After doing so you can navigate to the OpenVPN Access Server Admin UI. If you require a more advanced configuration you can go ahead and run the ovpn-init script:

/usr/local/openvpn_as/bin/ovpn-init
