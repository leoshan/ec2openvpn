AWS parameters supplied as user-data
---------------------------------------------

Define as:

KEY1=VALUE1
KEY2=VALUE2
...

Do not quote keys or values or use spaces on either side
of the '=' character. All parameters are optional.

public_hostname -- hostname that clients should use to contact the server.

admin_user (default=openvpn) -- Access Server administrative account name.

admin_pw -- administrative account initial password. Note that
this parameter is communicated to the instance via a
cleartext channel. A more secure method would be to ssh
to the instance and use the passwd command to set the
password.

license -- Access Server license key (without a license key, the
Access Server will support up to 2 concurrent connections).

reroute_gw (boolean, default=0) -- if 1, clients will route internet
traffic through the VPN.

reroute_dns (boolean, default=0) -- if 1, clients will route DNS
queries through the VPN.

In addition, the VPC CIDR block (if defined) will be made accessible to
VPN clients via NAT.
